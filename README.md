# staticwebsite-using-terraform
This Terraform project sets up an Amazon S3 bucket named "naveen" to host a static website. It configures the S3 bucket with ownership controls, public access settings, and access control lists (ACLs) to allow public-read access. Additionally, it uploads two HTML files ("index.html" and "error.html") to the S3 bucket and configures the bucket as a static website with "index.html" as the main page and "error.html" as the error page. This project is designed for hosting a static website on AWS S3 with the necessary security and configuration settings.
